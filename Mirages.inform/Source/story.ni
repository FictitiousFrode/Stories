		Stop the action;
	If the noun is not known:
		Say "You close your eyes and dream of [noun], but even with the talisman to guide the focus of your dreams, you can't quite picture it clearly enough. Perhaps it would work better with personal experience to draw upon.";

Chapter 5.3.1b - Fighting Robots

A golem is a kind of thing. A golem is usually fixed in place. A golem is usually scenery.
A golem has a dial called the power setting.

To decide which dial setting is the power of (G - a golem):
	Let dial be the power setting of G;
	Decide on the dial setting of the dial;

An amethyst golem is a golem. The power setting of amethyst golem is the purple amethyst dial.
The description is "It's a machine fashioned out of a transparent purple material, like a gigantic animated amethyst."
The magical description is "The golem shines with a [power of noun] purple light."

A ruby golem is a golem. The power setting is the red ruby dial.

Chapter 5.3.1c - Reset Lever

A lever is in Machine Room. "A lever is attached to the wall, next to the dials."
It is fixed in place.

Understand "use [lever]" as pulling.
Instead of pushing the lever, try pulling the lever.
Instead of pulling the lever:
	Say "With a great hiss, all the dials start spinning. After a few moments, they slow down and settle into new positions, just as the lever settles back to its original position with a hefty *chunk*.";
	Now the purple amethyst dial is sharp;
	Now the red ruby dial is bright;
	Now the blue azure dial is medium;
	Now the green emerald dial is dim;
	Now the yellow citrine dial is faint;

Chapter 5.3.1d - Control Dials

Turning up is an action applying to one touchable thing.
Understand "turn left on/-- [dial]" and "turn [dial] left" as turning up.

Carry out turning up a dial:
	If the noun is sharp:
		Now the noun is faint;
	Else:
		Now the dial setting of noun is the dial setting after the dial setting of noun;

Report turning up a dial:
	Say "You turn [the noun] to the left, where it softly clicks into the next slot."

Turning down is an action applying to one touchable thing.
Understand "turn right on/-- [dial]" and "turn [dial] right" as turning up.

Carry out turning down a dial:

	Else now the dial setting of noun is the dial setting before the dial setting of noun;

Report turning down a dial:
	Say "You turn [the noun] to the right, where it softly clicks into the next slot."

Part 5.3.2 - Gambling

[As the name might imply, the main puzzle for the Gambler is gambling.
Progression-wise, the goal is to win the statue's head. In order to do this, the player must accomplish two things:
	Rig the game, so that the outcome is not favoring the gambler.
		This is done by manipulating the machine room, which needs a lightsource.
		Alternatively, the player can deduce the pattern of winning machines, and let the Gambler do the waging.
	Find a bet that is acceptable for the statue.
The Gambler can also be persuaded to offer up clothing and body parts for wager.]

Chapter 5.3.2a - Wagering

[TODO: More cleanup needed here]

[Playing the game consists of two parts: Wagering items, and betting on a winner. One participant will choose a wager, and the other gets to pick which machine will win.
The settings in the machine room will determine which machine wins it's fight, and the Gambler knows how these are set up initially. Thus, any game where the Gambler gets to pick the winner, will be lost by the player. It is however possible for the player to deduce this pattern, and thus pick the winning machine and let the Gambler do the waging.

Gambling is then accomplished by two interconnected actions; the player chooses one of them and while the other is not called, it's effects are accomplished.]

The Gambler's golem is an object that varies. The Player's golem is an object that varies.
The Gambler's wager is an object that varies. The Player's wager is an object that varies.

Betting is an action applying to one visible thing.
Understand "bet --/on [something]" as betting.

Wagering it for is an action applying to two visible things.
Understand "wager [something] for [something]" as wagering it for.

Check an actor betting:
	If the noun is not a golem, say "You can only bet on which participant you think will win. To bet an item, you should WAGER IT FOR SOMETHING." instead;
	If the noun is not in arena floor, say "That fighter isn't participating right now." instead;

Carry out an actor betting:
	Let combatants be the list of golems in arena floor;
	Remove noun from combatants;
	Now the Player's golem is the noun;
	Now the Gambler's golem is entry 1 of combatants;
	Let potential offering be the offering;
	Let the potential prize be the matching wager of potential offering;
	Say "'I propose that you wager [potential offering] for [potential prize]. Is that an acceptable wager?'";
	If the player consents:
		Now the Player's wager is potential offering;
		Now the Gambler's wager is potential prize;
		Resolve golem combat;
	Else:
		Say "'Why don't you suggest a wager then?'";

[Make sure that the items being wagered are in fact controlled by the right persons]
Check an actor wagering something for something:
	If the noun is not enclosed by the player, say "You can only wager something under your control." instead;
	If the second noun is not in the display case and the second noun is not enclosed by the gambler, say "You can only bet for something that the Gambler controls." instead;

[The player initiated this game by setting the wager]
Carry out wagering something for something:
	If the noun is an acceptable wager for the second noun: [*The determination prints out acceptable refusal messages.]
		Now the player's wager is the noun;
		Now the gambler's wager is the second noun;
		Determine bets;
		Resolve golem combat;

[Determes if the wager offered by the player is acceptable]
To decide whether (offer - an object) is an acceptable wager for (prize - an object):
	If prize is the statue bust: [only accept sex toys for this]
		If offer is a sex toy:
			Say "'That seems like something I could find a use for.'";

				Decide no;
		Else:
			Say "'Not while I still have clothes to offer...'";
			Decide no;
	Else:
		Say "'I don't see how that would make sense.'";
		Decide no;

[Decides on an item controlled by the player that the gambler wants to play for]
To decide which object is the offering:
	Say "The Gambler is rummaging through your stuff[run paragraph on]";
	If the player carries the statue bust:
		say ", settling on the large statue bust you won from her.";
		Decide on the statue bust;
	Let potential offering be a random sex toy carried by the player;
	If the potential offering is not nothing:
		say ", settling on [the potential offering].";
		Decide on potential offering;
	Say ". She sighs, finding nothing of interest in your belongings. Her face contracts into a savage smile as her eyes wanders over your body,[run paragraph on]";
	Let chance be a random number from 1 to 10;
	If chance is 1:
		Say "her unsettling glare stopping landing on your groin.";
		Decide on your penis;
	If chance is between 2 and 4:
		Say "her unsettling glare landing on your backside.";
		Decide on your ass;
	If chance is between 5 and 10:
		Say "her unsettling glare landing on your backside mouth.";
		Decide on your mouth;

[Select what the Gambler is willing to offer for it:]
To decide which object is the matching wager of (offering - a thing):
	[Anything other than the bust or sex toys in the chest: accept anything]
	Let potential prizes be the list of things in the display case;
	Remove the list of sex toys from potential prizes;
	Remove the statue bust from potential prizes;

1-2b: Treasure
 * Have you looked in the obvious places?
 * Obviously, the treasure isn't where it's easy to find.

 * It's pretty dirty.. Have your tried *RUB*bing the dirt away?

2: Palace /Spired Building
2-1: How can I get here?
 * It's in the northeast corner of the plaza.
 * That stone slab looks too heavy to move on your own.
 * Perhaps the crumbling statue could be of use.
 * The statue is a golem, but it's missing some crucial parts.
 * Have you ever tried dreaming?
 * ...of power or pleasure?
2-2: Where can I find...?
2-2a: The Right Hand?
 * The Right Hand is very illuminating.
 * Finding it is blindingly obvious.
 * The Right Hand is currently undergoing service as a torch holder.
2-2b: The Left Hand?
 * The Left Hand has been apropriated for 'other' use.
 * It's currently in someone's private stash, viciously guarded.
 * All guards can be distracted with the correct shiny object, it's in the rules somewhere.
2-2c: The Head?
 * The head is currently someone's prized possession.
 * What's another word for head?
 * A bust isn't just busty...

 * TODO
3: Library / Cathedral
3-1: How can I get here?
 * It's in the northwest corner of the plaza.

 * Just walk in.
 * Although... Have you ever tried dreaming?
 * ...of wisdom or justice?

 * Knowledge comes from understanding.

 * Although... Have you ever tried dreaming?
 * ...of wealth or fortune?
4-2: How do I play?
 * Ask her about the game.
 * You can either decide the wager, or which fighter is your favorite.
 * Just WAGER 'something' FOR 'something'.
 * Or, you could just BET ON 'fighter'.
4-3: How can I teach her a lesson?
 * A true Gambler only wagers on a certain thing.
 * There is a pattern to which fighters win.
 * You could observe and take precious notes on winners.
 * Or, you could alter the pattern.
 * Have you found the control room?
 * It's quite illuminating.
 * Not to mention a-maze-ing.
 * Have you tried TURNing the dials LEFT or RIGHT?
 * Those dials are pretty non-descript...
 * Atleast to mortal vision.
 * Maybe there is another way to distinguish them?
 * Where would one find knowledge in this place?
 * Have you tried wagering for interesting things?
5: Barracks / Squat Ugly Building
5-1: How can I get here?
 * It's in the southeast corner of the plaza.
 * It's blocked by an imposing metal gate.
 * Which is more menacing than hindering.
 * Although... Have you ever tried dreaming?
 * ...of punishment or pain?
5-2: Help! I keep getting caught.
 * She zealously guards her private chambers.
 * Maybe she can be distracted by gifts?
 * Or impeded from restraining you?
 * Why isn't she using the cage?
 * Where would one find a lubricant...
5-3: How can I return the favor?
 * If you could just get her into a vulnerable position...
 * Gifts have special effects on girls...
 * She's been paying some attention to that cage...
 * Which is stuck...
 * TODO: Finish
